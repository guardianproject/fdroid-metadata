Auto Name:Orbot: Proxy with Tor
Description:
Tor is both software and an open network that helps you defend against network
surveillance that
threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and
relationships.

Orbot allows access to Tor by accessing a local SOCKS or HTTP proxy.
On a rooted device, the proxying can be completely transparent i.e. the app
that accesses the network need not be aware of the proxy's existence;
you can choose which apps go via the proxy in the settings.

If you don't have root access, there are some apps that are designed to work
closely with tor or allow proxied connections:
[[info.guardianproject.otr.app.im]], [[info.guardianproject.browser]] and
https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mariotaku.twidere.
There is also a proxy configurator addon for Firefox called
[https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob/downloads ProxyMob] (not yet
available from the Mozilla addon site).

Requires root: No, but you will need to use apps that allow proxies if root
is not granted.
