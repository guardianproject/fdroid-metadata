AutoName: GnuPrivacyGuard
Summary: GnuPG via gpgcli
Description: |-
    GnuPrivacyGuard extends the gpgcli command line tool to bring an integrated
    privacy engine to your Android. It gives you command line access to the entire
    GnuPG suite of encryption software. It also serves as the test bed for
    complete Android integration for all of GnuPG's crypto services, including
    OpenPGP, symmetric encryption, and more.

    GPG is GNUâ€™s tool for end-to-end secure communication and encrypted data
    storage. This trusted protocol is the free software alternative to PGP. This
    app is built upon GnuPG 2.1, the new modularized version of GnuPG that now
    supports S/MIME.

    GPG aims to provide an integrated experience, so clicking on PGP files should
    "just work". You can also share files to GPG to encrypt them. GPG will also
    respond when you click on a PGP fingerprint URL (one that starts with
    openpgp4fpr:).

    Before using GPG, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its installation
    process. Once it has completed, then you're ready to use it. The easiest way
    to get started with GPG is to install https://f-droid.org/packages/jackpal.androidterm. GPG will
    automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as long as you have the
    "Allow PATH extensions" settings enabled.
