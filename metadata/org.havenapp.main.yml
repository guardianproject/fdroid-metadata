AutoName: Haven
Summary: Protect personal spaces and possessions without compromising privacy

Description: |
 Haven is for people who need a way to protect their personal spaces
 and possessions without compromising their own privacy. It is an
 Android application that leverages on-device sensors to provide
 monitoring and protection of physical spaces. Haven turns any Android
 phone into a motion, sound, vibration and light detector, watching
 for unexpected guests and unwanted intruders. We designed Haven for
 investigative journalists, human rights defenders, and people at risk
 of forced disappearance to create a new kind of herd immunity. By
 combining the array of sensors found in any smartphone, with the
 world’s most secure communications technologies, like Signal and Tor,
 Haven prevents the worst kind of people from silencing citizens
 without getting caught in the act.

 Project Team

 Haven was developed through a collaboration between Freedom of the
 Press Foundation and Guardian Project. Prototype funding was
 generously provided by FoPF, and donations to support continuing work
 can be contributed through their site:

 Safety through Sensors

 Haven only saves images and sound when triggered by motion or volume,
 and stores everything locally on the device. You can position the
 device’s camera to capture visible motion, or set your phone
 somewhere discreet to just listen for noises. Get secure
 notifications of intrusion events instantly and access the logs
 remotely or anytime later.

 The follow sensors are monitored for a measurable change, and then
 recorded to an event log on the device:

 * Accelerometer: phone’s motion and vibration
 * Camera: motion in the phone’s visible surroundings from front or back camera
 * Microphone: noises in the enviroment
 * Light: change in light from ambient light sensor
 * Power: detect device being unplugged or power loss
